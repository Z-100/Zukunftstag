# React Examples

This entire part of the repository is dedicated to the means of explaining how a web app works behind the scenes.

There are comments all around the code, some of which you can use as a guide-line to what you're going to present.

## What to present?
**Here are some ideas of what you could present** \
Since there isn't a lot of time for this entire part in my case, I kept the ideas as simple as possible. \
And as the target audience is _children_, variables might just be simple enough for them to understand, so don't try
to make your presentation - or whatever it is you're doing - overkill! ;D

### Changing colours

* Start the app (obviously)
  * Change the colours locally (e.g. bg-[whatever])
  * Change the colours globally (tailwind.config.js)

### Changing content

* Do I have to say it again?
  * Change some sort of variable (There are "content-arrays")
  * Add new elements like \<p>\</p>
  * Or change the dimensions of a \<div>\</div>

----

Those are just some ideas, be creative!
