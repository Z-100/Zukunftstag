# Zukunftstag

This repository is meant to be presented to 10/11-year-olds figuring out what they wanna do in their future - or so I
was told.

It's very basic programming, which will take its time to present and explain though.

So instead of explaining everything, just talk about the technical stuff a bit and focus more on what the output
is. Children can't really comprehend stuff they can't see, so make them see something!

And in case you didn't yet find out what this repository is: It's a blueprint for the Zukunftstag. \
This means you maybe have to fork this repository and adjust some things here and there to make it fit your needs.

## Java Examples

In `java-examples` you'll find Java examples... and a `.bat`-file. \
It's a collection of small 'programs', which all have an output: They visualize 'complex' processes.

## React Examples

This directory contains an entire React app. Obviously you're not gonna be able to explain that entire thing to a bunch
of middle-schoolers... This is meant to show them that it's possible to create websites - or rather show them what a
website looks like behind all that fancy-schmancy browser magic.

Yes. This could've been written in HTML, but we all know that no one likes that stuff anymore, since it's outdated or
something like that. I'm no frontend dev.

Anyway, show the kids stuff like what the effects of changing the colour in the code has on the website or how to
include an image or a gif in a website! :D

Start the React app:

```shell
cd react-examples
npm i
npm run dev
```

----

Of course, you can show either one of them, both or none at all (But why would you want to read it then?). \
My recommendation is to start simple with the `Matrix` and then directly start with `React`, as this is rather
time-consuming.

Have fun, enjoy this masterpiece of software engineering...

Cheers
