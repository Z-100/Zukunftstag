# Zukunftstag

This repository is meant to be presented to 10/11-year-olds figuring out what they wanna do in their future \
Or so I was told.

It's very basic programming, which will take its time to present and explain though.

So instead of explaining everything, just talk about the technical stuff a bit and focus more on what the output
is. Children can't really comprehend stuff they can't see, so make them see something!

## Java Examples

In `java-examples` you'll find Java examples... and a `.bat`-file. \
It's a collection of small 'programs', which all have an output: They visualize 'complex' processes.

## React Examples

This directory contains an entire React app. Obviously one isn't able to explain that to a bunch of middle-schoolers. \
This is meant to show them that it's possible to create websites. This could've been HTML, but we all know no one likes
html anymore, since it's outdated or something like that. I'm no frontend dev.

Anyway, show the kids stuff like what the effects of changing a colour in the code has on the website or how to
include an image or a gif in a website! :D

Start the React app:

```shell
cd react-examples
npm i
npm run start
```

Enjoy this masterpiece of software engineering
