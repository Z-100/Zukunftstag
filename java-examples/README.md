# Java Examples

This is a lil entry to minor programming which can be presented to the kiddos

## Matrix.bat

Show them how easily they can create a little "program" on their own.

1. Create a .bat file
2. Write a simple Hello World
3. Write the Matrix code

* Explain `echo`
    * It outputs anything
    * It can output Text
* Explain the loop of `:a (...) goto :a`
* Explain the `%RANDOM%`

And of course show them the cool Matrix stuff.

## HelloWorld

Then lead over to the world of Java and show them the Hello World.

* Explain that Java is much more complex and needs more to get started
  * Don't go into detail though
  * Explain the differences of `echo` & `println`

## Matrix.java

Show them the Matrix equivalent in a _real_ programming language.

* Compare the bat and Java files
  * To-green-setter
  * The loop
  * RANDOM <=> randomUUID
* Talk about speed

## TaschenRechner

Now this one's a more complex thing and probably too complex for 10/11-year-olds. \
Either show them the Calculator or begin with the React example.
